Once Valid is generated, clkc takes the value of '0' after a time td3 that corresponds to the delays of the NOR gate the charging time of the delay cell, and the inverter.

    "Since we do not have experience running the mixed-signal (MS) flow with xschem, we implement the flow used in tiny tapeout (http://tinytapeout.com/) (Openlane) with gf180m. To validate the performance of the code, we use cocotb (https://www.cocotb.org/) to test our code with Python. We have a little bit of experience with eSim (https://esim.fossee.in/mixed-signal-design-marathon) to run mixed signals, but we do not know if eSim is going to be the platform to use during the PICO contest, we decided to present the simulations of the asynchronous SAR logic with the flow used in tiny tapeout. One of the main tasks of our proposal is to determine the tools used in the PICO contest to run the MS flow and get familiar with it."

    "As mentioned before, we propose an 11-bit differential SAR-ADC with a bootstrapping technique for sampling and an asynchronous logic for the PICO contest. An adequate characterization of the ENOB of the track and hold circuit since it determines the ENOB of the ADC. A strong study must be done to understand the mixed signal flow with Xschem. Finally, layout techniques are mandatory, such as common centroid, interdigitated, and symmetry to mitigate undesired effects, and maintain both inputs identical as possible."
